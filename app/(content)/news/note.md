## Intercepting Routes

Intercepting Routes in Next.js refers to the ability to render additional content, such as modals or overlays, on top of an existing page without leaving the current route entirely. This is particularly useful for providing enhanced navigation experiences, like showing a modal over a page without losing the current context.

This feature is commonly achieved through parallel routing and dynamic route interception in the Next.js app directory.


### How Route Interception Works

#### Parallel Routing:
 - Define independent "slots" for rendering multiple routes simultaneously.

 - Allows specific content (e.g., a modal or sidebar) to overlay or augment the existing page.

#### Interception Mechanics:
 - You can navigate to a route and render its content in a specific slot while keeping the primary content visible.

 - Intercepted routes are treated differently from normal full-page navigation.
