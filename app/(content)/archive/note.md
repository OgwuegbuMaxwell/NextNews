## What is Parallel Routing in Next.js?

Parallel Routing in Next.js is a feature introduced in the app directory to allow rendering multiple, independent layouts or routes simultaneously in a single view. It enables creating complex UI structures like dashboards, modals, or nested routes with independent rendering behaviors.

### Key Concepts of Parallel Routing

1. Independent Routes Rendered Simultaneously:
    - You can define multiple routes (or layouts) that are rendered in parallel.

    - Each route is independent but can coexist in the same view.

2. Slot-Based Architecture:
    - Parallel routing uses slots to define where each route's content will be rendered.

3. Real-World Use Cases:
    - Dashboards with multiple panels (e.g., sidebar, main content, notifications).

    - Applications with modals or overlays that coexist with the main content.

    - Multi-pane workflows where users can interact with different panes simultaneously.
